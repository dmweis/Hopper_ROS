Hopper (Named after Grace Hopper) is a 3D printed hexapod robot running on ROS.
It's brain is a Raspberry Pi 3 running Ubunut Xenial with ROS Kinetic.
The platform is modeled and 3D printed by me and is still a work in progress. It's heavily inspired by [PhantomX Hexapod from Trossen robotics](http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx)
